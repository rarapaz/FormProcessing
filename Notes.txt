This example is susceptable to a SQL Injection.

Use any UserId and for password use:
    1' or '1' = '1
 The result will be to print the entire login table.
 
 Here's another one:
 
 For UserId use jpepe'; -- some text
     and use any password.
     The result will be to log in jpepe.
     
 Never use mysqli_multi_query($con, $sql) because it will execute
 multiple SQL statements per call. A SQL Injection for user id could be:
 
     hbentley'; DROP TABLE Login; 

 
 This example is also susceptable to HTML Injection.
 
 REGISTER new user name using a tag like <hr color="red" />, watch what happens.
 Now use SQL injection to print entire table.
 To prevent this uncomment the test_input function.
 
 Here's more HTML Injections. Try register user name:
 
 <img src="images/ic_drawer.jpg" alt="text" />    or
 
 <img src="javascript:alert(&quot; Malicious cookie attack &quot;);" alt="text"/>
